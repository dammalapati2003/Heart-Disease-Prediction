# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The heart disease prediction project uses patient health details like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and chest pain type to check the chance of having heart disease. Logistic regression finds patterns with math formulas, decision tree follows simple rules, and random forest combines many trees for better and more reliable results.
